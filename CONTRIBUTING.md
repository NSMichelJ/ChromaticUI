# From the terminal:
git switch main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

You can also sync from GitHub by clicking Sync Fork on your fork‚Äôs page.

#### Create a New Branch

- Never work directly on main/master.

## Best Practices üåü

To ensure your contributions are useful and easy to integrate, follow these recommendations:

### 1. Check Open Issues

- Before starting work, check the [open issues](https://github.com/NSMichelJ/ChromaticUI/issues).
- If you find an issue you can solve and there‚Äôs no open PR for it, go ahead!
- Use #issue-number in your commit or PR to link it to the corresponding issue.

```bash
git commit -m "fix(generator): fix palette generation #123"
```

Leave a comment on the issue indicating you‚Äôre working on it. This helps avoid duplicates.

### 2. Check Open PRs

**Before opening a new PR:**

- Check open PRs to make sure you‚Äôre not working on something already in progress.
- If someone is already working on a similar change, you can collaborate:
  - Provide suggestions in the comments.
  - Help review their code.
  - Offer additional testing if needed.

### 3. Keep Your Commits Clean and Descriptive

- Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive message. Use the commit convention:

```bash
git commit -m "type description (preferably in English)"
```

- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for clear messages:

```bash
git commit -m "type(scope): description (preferably in English)"
```

- feat: New features.
- fix: Bug fixes.
- docs: Documentation changes.
- style: Formatting changes.
- refactor: Code refactoring.

#### Example

```bash
git commit -m "feat(export): add export to Tailwind 4 with OKCHL #45"
```

### 4. Follow Project Conventions

- Astro: Keep files modular and componentized.
- React: Use functional components and hooks.
- Tailwind CSS: Prioritize Tailwind classes before writing custom CSS.

### 5. Update Your Branch Frequently

- To avoid conflicts, keep your branch synced with the project‚Äôs main branch.

### 6. Participate in Discussions

**If you receive comments or suggestions on your PR:**

- Respond promptly and participate actively in the conversation.

- If you need clarification, don‚Äôt hesitate to ask.

### 7. Document Your Changes
